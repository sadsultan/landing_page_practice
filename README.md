# landing_page_practice

A landing page excercise. Currently, the color palette has deliberately chosen to be as offensive to the eyes as possible. This is coupled with the fact that there is no java script files being used and the text is entirely placeholder / dummy text. Only basic css and basic html has been used to create this page.

The images have been taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and the artists for the intro image and the image used in the cards are dids and steve johnson respectively.
