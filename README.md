# landing_page_practice

A landing page excercise. Currently, the color palette has deliberately chosen to be as offensive to the eyes as possible. This is coupled with the fact that there is no java script files being used and the text is entirely placeholder / dummy text. Only basic css and basic html has been used to create this page.

The images have been taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and the artists for the intro image and the image used in the cards are dids and steve johnson respectively.

Note: The images in the ref_images folder are images of the original webpage layout that I have essentially parodied in my own work. It would be quite useless to use this repository but if you wish to do so, you can use this code and change the colors used to match with the ones mentioned in the ref_img_2 file to obtain code for a useable webpage that resembles ref_img_1.
